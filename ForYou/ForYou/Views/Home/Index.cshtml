                It was never meant to be serious.  
                It started as a joke, a bet, just us messing around thinking it was all just for fun.
            </p>,
                thinking it would fade the moment it stopped being fun.

                    You’re stubborn and you always have been.
                    You stand your ground, you don’t fold easily,
                    and once you’ve decided something, there’s no changing your mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tease you about it, but truthfully,
                    it’s one of the things I admire most.

                <p>
                    Because that same stubbornness is what makes you strong,
                    what keeps you going when things get hard,
                    and what makes you fight for the things and people you care about.

                Loving you made me realise that love doesn’t need grand gestures
                unless it truly has to be grand.
            </p>

            <p>
                That loving someone can be effortless,
                yet still be the most rewarding thing in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                All I find myself thinking about is spending my life with you 
                growing old with you, building something real together,
                and creating our own happy family.
            </p>

            <p>
                You showed me what true love actually is.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’ve helped me grow into someone I never thought I could be,
                all while dealing with everything you’ve been going through yourself.

                That last year on campus, the time we spent together,

                the only person I truly had was you.
